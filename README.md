# Moonlander
Remake of the arcade game "Lunar Lander" for a show laser system. If no show laser system is present, a SDL display can be used to play the game on a computer.

## Requirements
The SDL library must be present. On a mac, the SDL library can be installed with the following command:
```
sudo port install libsdl2 libsdl2_gfx libsdl2_image libsdl2_mixer libsdl2_ttf
```
